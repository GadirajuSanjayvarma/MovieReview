I strongly believe that computer science is one domain where we can provide solutions to various problems. so I entered into the field of deep learning computer vision where we can provide solutions and accomplish good results with it. I also love developing websites and integrating them with deep learning so anyone can use them without much complexity. I also love reading books and watching documentaries.
       If you want to contact me then good luck in contact section. </p>
